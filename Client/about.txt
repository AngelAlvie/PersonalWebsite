- Also interested in mathematical analysis of algorithms in creating more robust code.
- Graduated High School from Natomas Pacific Pathways prep, where I learned about civic engagement

My interest in computer science and programming started in elementary school, where I took a community college class on robotics over the summer. Since then, I've been enthralled by the functions of electronic devices. I went to Natomas Pacific Pathways Prep (Otherwise known as NP3) for high school, where I learned about law and civic engagement. While in High School, I continued my interest in electronics by programming Arduino and Basic Stamp micro-controllers for small hardware projects. Programming those devices lead me into software development. I moved from Arduino to Processing then to Java and onward. 
I came to MIT in the fall of 2016. While here, I joined two clubs renowned for empowering students with access to technology: The Student Information Processing Board (SIPB), and TechX. The SIPB has a focus on providing computing services to the MIT community. These services include scripts, XVM, and Debathena. TechX is an Umbrella organization for several organizations, each tasked with a specific means of connecting students with technology. These include the student hackathons HackMIT and MakeMIT, as well as XFair, a career fair in February for MIT students. Other committees include ProjX and Think. I'm part of two subcommittees of TechX: ProjX and Dev-ops. ProjX distributes thousands of dollars to student projects every year, along with providing support and resources to make student projects succeed. TechX Dev-ops is an internal committee tasked with building and deploying software solutions that all of techX uses. You might see some of my projects that I've made for TechX in my gallery. Despite having worked on software development in recent years, I am interested in transitioning into the field of artificial intelligence, and using mathematics and functional programming to create secure programs.
